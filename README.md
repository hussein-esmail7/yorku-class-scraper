## What is this?
This program outputs a JSON file that is generated by traversing York
University's course website.

## Requirements

## Installation
At the moment, you can only `git clone` this repository.

### Installing Through Git
```
git clone https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/yorku-class-scraper
cd yorku-class-scraper/
```

## Running the program
To use this program, you have to make sure you are in the correct directory
(using the `cd` command).

```
python3 yorku-scrape.py
```

### Arguments
There are two options to input your arguments into this program:
1. When the program asks for it if it is not given in the Terminal, or
2. In the Terminal. See [Command Arguments](#command-arguments) for the ways to
   put it in.


#### What the program asks
1. `Semester`: First the program asks what semester you want to get courses
   from. It displays a numbered list, and you input a number corresponding to
   your choice.
2. `Course Code`: This is the first 2-4 letters that are in a course code. For
   example, in "EECS 1001", the code would be "EECS". You can type multiple
   opions like "eecs math" as your input (separated by spaces and nothing
   else), and it would get all the courses with this course and put all the
   results in a single JSON file. You an also type "ALL" to get every
   course in a semester into a single JSON file.
3. `JSON File Name`: This is pretty self-explanatory, but what you want to name
   your output JSON file. This asks before it starts iterating through all the
   courses in case it takes a while so you don't have to sit at your computer
   waiting for it to ask you. At the moment, it only makes a JSON file in the
   same directory as the file.

#### Command Arguments
- `-h`, `--help`: Help message and exit program.
- `-o`, `--output`: Input the output JSON file name as a string.
- `-c`, `--code`: Input the course code(s) you want to get. Examples: EECS,
  ADMS, EN, ENG, etc. if you are inputting multiple, make sure to have it in
  quotations. Examples: "EECS ADMS", "EECS, WRIT"
- `-s`, `--sem`, `--semester`: Input the semester you want as a string
  (Example: FW, SU)
- `-q`, `--quiet`: Quiet mode. Only display text when required (progress bars
  not included, use `--no-progress` for this).
- `--no-progress`: No progress bars. Independent from `--quiet`.

## Files in this Repository
- `dict-format.pdf`: PDF of how the JSON is formatted in case you want to make your own program that uses this data (and I recommend you do! I want this repository to help others).
- `dict-format.tex`: LaTeX source file for `dict-format.pdf`
- `json/`: This folder contains JSON files I've already created by using this program to potentially save the next person some time.
- `yorku_scrape.py`: Main Python program
- `yorku_scrape_v2.py`: A new version of the main Python program that uses the
  "View Active Course Timetables" page instead of "Search Current Courses
  By..." -> "Subject"
