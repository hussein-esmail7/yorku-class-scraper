## What is this?
This program outputs a JSON file that is generated by traversing York
University's course website.

## Requirements

## Installation
At the moment, you can only `git clone` this repository.

### Installing Through Git
```
git clone https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/yorku-class-scraper
cd yorku-class-scraper/
```

## Running the program
To use this program, you have to make sure you are in the correct directory
(using the `cd` command).

```
python3 yorku-scrape.py
```

### Arguments
At the moment, there is not functionality to input your options right in the
command line, but this can be added later. At the moment, the program will ask
you for these options directly after you start it.

#### What the program asks
1. `Semester`: First the program asks what semester you want to get courses
   from. It displays a numbered list, and you input a number corresponding to
   your choice.
2. `Course Code`: This is the first 2-4 letters that are in a course code. For
   example, in "EECS 1001", the code would be "EECS". You can type multiple
   opions like "eecs math" as your input (separated by spaces and nothing
   else), and it would get all the courses with this course and put all the
   results in a single JSON file. You an also type "ALL" to get every
   course in a semester into a single JSON file.
3. `JSON File Name`: This is pretty self-explanatory, but what you want to name
   your output JSON file. This asks before it starts iterating through all the
   courses in case it takes a while so you don't have to sit at your computer
   waiting for it to ask you. At the moment, it only makes a JSON file in the
   same directory as the file.
