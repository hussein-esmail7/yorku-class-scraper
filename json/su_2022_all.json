        "Description": "Students will be immersed in an interactive and experiential course that will allow them to better understand the responsibility each of us has in the achievement of reconciliation and establishment of collaborative diversity. The Indigenous roots of restorative justice will be considered and applied to consider various approaches to address contemporary challenges. Topics include: inclusion, being an authentic ally, performative action, Indigenous dispute resolution, effective communication, beyond human rights, barrier reduction and Indigenous principles. Lectures, role plays and small group discussions will be used to consider the justice-seeking experience and contemplate the global impact of the intersection of Indigenous issues and dispute resolution (including drawing upon examples from the Indigenous client and working with Indigenous legal representatives). Students will have the opportunity to consider deep rooted systemic bias and solutions to overcoming such in a culturally sensitive and safe environment.",

This course challenges you to engage with other ways of knowing and being, and to rethink your taken-for-granted knowledge and beliefs through the comparative analysis of the human condition. This course will take a problem-based approach to a range of topics such as: the effects of race and racism, sources of religious conflict, alternate genders and sexualities, First Nations and health, international development and issues of social inequality. Students are encouraged to bring their own knowledge and experience as the first step in \"thinking like an anthropologist\" (i.e. rethinking the taken-for-granted). The emphasis in this course is developing skills (analytical thinking, reading, writing). Course credit exclusions: AP/ANTH 1130 6.00 (prior to Fall 2016), AP/ANTH 1120 6.00 (prior to Fall 2014).",

        "Description": "Offers the student research experience as part of a Biology research team. The student must make arrangements with a faculty member before enrolling in this course. Students are expected to commit to approximately 5-10 hours per week (on average) for one term. The student and faculty member must sign a form in which they agree on the type and amount of work to be done, and the form must be approved by the Instructor before the student will be allowed to enroll. Students may enrol in this course during any term, and there is no limit to the number of terms in which they are allowed to enroll. Students will not be allowed to enroll in a biology research practicum course with their Honours Thesis (SC/BIOL 4000 8.00) supervisor during the same terms that they are enrolled in SC/BIOL 4000 8.00. Students will be required to obtain safety training, such as WHMIS, if appropriate to the type of research undertaken. The course is intended only for students in Biology or Biochemistry majors.",

Students may enroll in this course during any term, and there is no limit to the number of terms in which they are allowed to enroll. Students will not be allowed to enroll in a biology research practicum course with their Honours Thesis (SC/BIOL 4000 8.00) supervisor during the same terms that they are enrolled in SC/BIOL 4000 8.00. Students will be required to obtain safety training, such as WHMIS, if appropriate to the type of research undertaken. The course is intended only for students in Biology or Biochemistry majors.",

Students learn skills to support those issues faced by many organizations, whether they are large companies or small-scale entrepreneurial businesses. The topics covered in this course are useful to anyone representing a corporation or interacting with those who do. Students examine the fundamental legal principles governing in-house practice and explore how innovation in legal practice is often driven by the client demands of in-house counsel (to address their own business clients' needs), such as changes to standard hourly billing models; the influence of \"business-side\" trends on the legal profession (e.g., application of Lean/Six Sigma\"); the use of cloud- based legal technology platforms; and the increasing need to act as a predictive, forward-looking risk manager in addition to legal counsel. Legal issues are examined in the context of practice-area scenarios where the law is applied to facts and/or examined from a critical perspective.",

        "Description": "Ethics, access to justice and professionalism-locally and globally-have increasingly become foundational topics of attention over the past several years at all levels of the justice community. This course is designed to look directly at those issues. Specifically, this course provides an introduction to the Canadian legal profession, professional rules, norms and values, regulatory institutions and processes, and the practical ethical issues that lawyers face. It focuses on the context of the Canadian lawyer's many and varied roles: as advocate, advisor, employee, employer, entrepreneur or public servant. It considers the various contexts in which lawyers work: in solo practice, firm practice, government practice or in-house. It also examines lawyers as members of a profession with collective responsibilities in relation to the public interest and access to justice. The course situates these issues within their modern-day context; that is, within a context characterized by local diverse communities, normative pluralism, globalization and transnationalism. This course is taught in an interactive online format, with regular instructor and classmate interaction. In each section of the course, students will do independent reading, review multimedia content in the course website, and communicate with their instructor(s) and fellow students. Regular group work, problem-based learning, practical exercises, and research and writing assignments will be required at key points during the course. At the conclusion of the course, students will participate in exam review and write an invigilated final exam.",

        "Description": "This course covers the core concepts in two foundational areas of the Canadian common law -- contract and tort -- by combining that material into one course. There are two overarching bases for the decision to combine contract and torts into one course. First, there is a natural overlap between these two substantive areas of law and as such there is a strong pedagogical reason for the study of these two areas in one course. Second, candidates for the LL.M. program will benefit from the additional opportunity provided to them to take one further subject course instead of taking two separate courses. From a pedagogical standpoint, there is merit to this combination of courses as it affords occasion to talk about the shape and inter-relationship of the common law categories. As this course is envisioned as an introduction, there is an effort to guide candidates through these legal disciplines in a manner that speaks to the distinct features as well as the overlapping points of each. The introduction to the course illustrates to candidates a common origin for contract and torts; thereby underlining the basis of the combination. Beginning with the discussion of remedies, the contemporary connection between contract and torts will be explored in more detail. Finally, candidates are taken through the business/economic scenarios in which contract and torts overlap.",

        "Description": "The course is designed for Engineering students interested in refreshing and expending their general chemistry knowledge while exploring the relationship between structure of matter, properties and processing. This course will focus mainly at covering important introductory concept to understand solution chemistry including reactivity, thermochemistry, structure and properties of materials. The course is divided in six sections. The first section covers an introduction to the topic of Materials Science and its impact on our daily lives as well as future trends and review key chemistry concepts required for this course. The second section will present the states of matter (gas, liquid and solid), their physical characteristics and the forces holding materials together (bonding and intermolecular forces). The third section will expend on the liquid phase and properties of solutions including equilibrium, solubility, pH and pKa. The fourth section will deal with thermochemistry and its first law with an emphasis on enthalpy as well as phase changes and phase diagrams. Section six will present an introduction to the properties of solids (electronic and mechanical) and criteria in the selection of materials will also be discussed. Section seven will present in more details structure-properties and processing of soft materials (natural and artificial polymer) in the context of the material covered in the other sections. Prerequisites: 12U chemistry or equivalent. Course credit exclusion: SC/CHEM 1000 3.00.",

Youth are understood in terms of their media uses and productions as learners, consumers, producers and artists across complex relations of power, discursive frameworks and dynamic experiences. Oriented toward conceptualizing \"youth,\" \"culture\" and \"media practices\" in relational, historically nuanced and culturally situated ways, we will examine and undertake qualitative youth media research with critical and reflexive theoretical and methodological tools. Our goal is to balance an understanding of hegemonic forces of commodification controlled by corporate media with emerging and changing relations in which youth collectively transform the conditions, forms and directions of their media participation.

The course will incorporate making in the forms of sketching, rapid prototyping, modeling with found objects, which students will upload to the course site. Visual research and cognitive tools such as concept mapping will also be incorporated in the course assignments. There will be short-answer Forum questions and online discussions to facilitate writing opportunities. Open to non-majors.",

More specifically, the course categorizes and studies those risks that are associated with financial markets (liquidity risk, pricing risk, credit risk, among other financial risks) as well as those risks that arise from operations of an enterprise, regulations, digital transformation, the impacts of the environment or a catastrophe (among other non-financial risks). Also, the course examines in detail the various aspects of the insurance mechanism as a route to manage some of the aforementioned risks. The course combines classical lectures with biweekly presentations by visiting risk professionals, thus immersing the students into theory and practice of modern risk management.

        "Description": "This course presents and analyzes a sequence of basic ideas, topics and problems arising in Economics. For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined.

        "Description": "This course extends the analysis of basic Economics ideas, topics and problems begun in AP/ECON 1530 3.00. Again, relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of Economic issues and how they can be resolved. The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations, eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand (supply) and the foundations of demand (supply) functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming. As in AP/ECON 1530 3.00, many topics and issues are addressed and problem framing and problem solving abilities are enhanced. Prerequisite: AP/ECON 1530 3.00 or equivalent.

A central assumption of the course is that cultural representations impact the ways that educators understand themselves and their work. The course raises questions about the significance of cultural depictions, their historical and social formation, and their value for theorizing multiple learning environments.",

        "Description": "Indigenous people in Canada and around the world are continually interpreting, portraying, and recasting Indigenous histories and knowledge. Shared through visual art, story, ceremony and cultural practices this knowledge is continually regenerated, weaving in and out of personal, familial and community narratives. This course examines Indigenous ancestral knowledge with a focus on how this knowledge continues to inform people's understanding of themselves, their understanding of the world and their understanding of themselves in the contemporary world. The course content will include but is not limited to Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, Nehiyawak, Mi'kmaq and Lenape knowledge. Teacher Candidates will have the opportunity to: * Engage with Indigenous literature, film and visual art accessing Indigenous knowledge through pathways that connect the ancestors to the present. * Participate in Urban Indigenous Community events and share the significance of participation to their learning and understanding. * Consider how Ancestral knowledge contributes to their understanding of pedagogy. * Develop their own awareness of the presence and significance of Ancestral knowledge in their understanding of themselves as teachers. * Consider the possibilities and limitations available for Integrating Indigenous Knowledge in public school classrooms. * Drawing on Ancestral knowledge to develop their own understanding of its significance in cultivating Indigenous student well-being. Students will work collaboratively to develop their understanding of how Indigenous knowledge can be successfully integrated in public school classrooms across curriculums and grade levels. This course is only open to students in the Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree program.",

        "Description": "Mathematics learning at the K-8 level is best supported with multiple representations and hands-on activities. This course will offer opportunities for future PJ and JI teachers to explore these key mathematical processes, identified in the Ontario curriculum, through investigations, reflections, and selective readings from the literature. Many pre-service teachers have not themselves experienced learning and doing mathematics with these broader, more connected and inclusive approaches. They lack the confidence and the background resources to support these mathematical processes and approaches with their students. Reworking sample mathematics with these supports, including manipulatives (as described in the Ontario Curriculum) and appropriate technology (dynamic geometry, as identified in the Ontario Curriculum) provides opportunities for future teachers to develop their mathematical repertoire and confidence, as well as their capacity to offer active engagement with multiple approaches that can support the diversity of student thinking found in problem solving situations. The activities selected, and the associated group projects, will also cross-curricular boundaries and cultural boundaries to connect mathematics and spatial reasoning to real world experiences. These activities and reflections will also connect to learning objectives and concepts from science, social sciences such as geography, and visual arts, supporting a broad range of connected student learning in the STEM and STEAM disciplines, and beyond. A key component will be building and exploring embodied approaches, including spatial reasoning, kinesthetic and spatial-visual representations to support learning and thinking for children and in the elementary classrooms. These approaches are also central in the practices of mathematics, the sciences and many of the arts, at all levels and across most cultures. They will support a lifetime of student and teacher learning. Only open to students in BEd.",

        "Description": "The objectives of 1012 are threefold: providing a first exposure to event-driven programming, teaching students a set of computing skills (including reasoning about algorithms, tracing programs, test-driven development, unit testing), and providing an introduction to computing within a mobile, net-centric context. It uses problem-based approach to expose the underlying concepts and an experiential laboratory to implement them. A mature mobile software infrastructure (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is used so that students can pick up key programming concepts (such as variables and control flow) within a client-server context without being bogged down in complex or abstract constructs. Laboratory exercises expose students to a range of real-world problems with a view of motivating computational thinking and grounding the material covered in lecture. Prerequisites: One of (1)-(3) below must be met: (1) (New high school curriculum): One 4U Math course with a grade of at least 75%. (2) Completion of six credits from York University MATH courses (not including courses with second digit 5) with a GPA of 5.00 or better over these credits; (3) Completion of six credits from York University mathematics courses whose second digit is 5, with an average grade not below 7.00 (B+).

        "Description": "A study of fundamental data structures and their use in the efficient implementation of algorithms. Topics include abstract data types, lists, stacks, queues, trees and graphs. Prerequisites: cumulative GPA of 4.50 or better over all major EECS courses (without second digit \"5\"), LE/EECS 1030 3.00 or LE/EECS 2030 3.00, LE/EECS 1028 3.00 OR SC/MATH 1028 3.00 or LE/EECS 1019 3.00 or SC/MATH 1019 3.00. Previously offered as: LE/CSE 2011 3.00. The course discusses the fundamental data structures commonly used in the design of algorithms. Abstract operations on data structures are specified using pre and post conditions and/or system invariants. Trade-offs between a number of different implementations of each abstract data types (ADT) are analyzed. Each algorithm operating on data structures is proved correct using loop invariants or induction. Both formal and informal proofs are introduced though most of the reasoning is done informally. Data structures are coded and unit tested in an object-oriented language. Selecting the appropriate ADT and a suitable implementation depending on the application is covered.

        "Description": "This course continues the separation of concern theme introduced in LE/EECS 1020 3.00 and LE/EECS1021 3.00. While 1020 and 1021 focuses on the client concern, this course focuses on the concern of the implementer. Hence, rather than using an API (Application Programming Interface) to build an application, the student is asked to implement a given API. Topics include implementing classes (non-utilities, delegation within the class definition, documentation and API generation, implementing contracts), aggregations (implementing aggregates versus compositions and implementing collections), inheritance hierarchies (attribute visibility, overriding methods, abstract classes versus interfaces, inner classes); applications of aggregation and inheritance in concurrent programming and event-driven programming; recursion; searching and sorting including quick and merge sorts); stacks and queues; linked lists; binary trees. Prerequisites: cumulative GPA of 4.50 or better over all major EECS courses (without second digit \"5\"); LE/EECS1021 3.00 or LE/EECS 1020 (prior to Fall 2015) 3.00 or LE/EECS1022 3.00 or LE/EECS 1720 3.00.

        "Description": "Intelligent Innovation Ecosystem Design is a two-week intensive course that unlocks the strategies behind creating a thriving Tech & Innovation Ecosystem - leveraging the incredible story of Toronto's rapid rise to global prominence. In 2021, Toronto was ranked as North America's fastest growing tech market, with 80,000 tech jobs created. This development followed Toronto winning the 3-year bid to host Collision Conference, North America's largest tech conference with 33,000 attendees, in 2019. In the last decade, Toronto has moved from a local presence into an international one: an ecosystem that nurtures and powers up high-growth startups, scaleups and unicorns (1B or higher valuations). What sparks and drives this next-generation innovation ecosystem? In this hands-on course taught by Guest Lecturers from the most influential ecosystem design minds in Toronto, students will learn the frameworks and strategies behind sparking, scaling, and sustaining Tech & Innovation. This course focuses on real-life application, following the startup journey from early-stage to exit across several verticals (e.g. fintech), and examining the crucial role played by ecosystem design. Furthermore, this MBA offering is enhanced by site visits to strategic locations, experiential learning opportunities, and facetime with leading innovators. Emphasis is placed on critical thinking and practical application, in order for students to supercharge their careers and infuse key learnings into their local tech ecosystems.",

        "Description": "This course is primarily geared to students interested in working in venture capital or other private equity organizations at some point in their careers. It is also valuable for those who intend to work alongside venture capitalists as managers of firms being financed by such investors and for students interested in applying aspects of private equity investing to established organizations. The course is divided into four modules focusing on the venture capital cycle including fundraising, investing, and exiting. In the final module the course explores new frontiers in venture capital including corporate venturing. Throughout the course we touch on career issues with respect to private equity. Prerequisite: all 5000-series Required Foundations of Management Core Courses.",

        "Description": "This course has four principal objectives. The first is to help students take a more structured and scientific approach to the evaluation of data. Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research.",

It is also a common belief that compensation schemes tied to the bottom line and stock price lead to actions more in the manager's interest than the firm's interest. This course looks at these issues and identifies best practices to strengthen corporate governance and accountability in the organization through appropriate design of executive compensation schemes. The revised course description reflects the reality that executive compensation dominates all benefits in terms of impact on accountability and governance.",

Concepts and techniques of video production for the web, multimedia and mobile media platforms are addressed, from the workflow of a project to the editing, sound, and final output formats. Assigned projects provide students with the opportunity to explore the creative and communicative potential of very short video forms through the completion of assigned creative work. Technical demonstrations and workshops provide students with a wide range of versatile tools and approaches through which ideas may be explored and developed. Studio production and experimentation complement readings, discussions, and viewings, resulting in a more thorough understanding of historical and contemporary discourses surrounding the mobile video image.",

        "Description": "Learning from Los Angeles is a study-abroad course that will explore the fantastic histories, myths, and contradictions of the first modern media city and the image it fashioned for itself. Through weekly readings and field trips, students will learn LA history by walking the urban fabric of the city itself to connect directly with its rich and diverse cultural histories, from vernacular subcultures to media empires. As an experiential field course, Learning from Los Angeles will blend screenings, readings, and field trips designed around distinct thematic modules, through which rotating topics about the city and its cultural histories will be covered. Los Angeles is the first and only modern city ever to have produced an extensive history of the image while promoting an image of its own history. As Los Angeles cultural critic Norman L. Klein has argued, Los Angeles is a city that has long thrived on the continual erasure and reinvention of its own myth. This course is committed to diving into this productive contradiction between image and history to unpack this complex and enigmatic place caught between a fantastic idea on the one hand and the lived materiality on the other. While exploring the gilded legends from the silent to the studio era, the course will simultaneously take a street view of Los Angeles and connect students with the many communities and cultural organizations committed to its unknown and forgotten histories, such as the LA Urban Rangers, the LAPD (Los Angeles Poverty Department), The Center for Land Use Interpretation, and the LA River Revitalization Project. Open to non-majors.",

The Workshop is offered every term and allows students to complete modules on legal research and writing that support the development of skills for long graduate research papers. Several live online sessions will be held throughout the term to afford students the opportunity for discussion about their research projects and to ask questions of a research and writing instructor. There will be an opportunity to receive feedback on research and writing skills. To get the most out of the course, it is recommended that students take it after successfully completing at least one or two terms of the program and have a topic in mind for their MRP or SRP.",

It provides a critique of the colonial construction of exclusionary categories, including gender and sexuality, which have shaped many mainstream, non-Indigenous feminisms. Utilizing a wide variety of material, including books, scholarly articles, personal narratives, poetry, and film, it analyzes whether these categories can be redefined and reclaimed within an Indigenous, decolonizing, feminist framework.

        "Description": "This course uses a diverse range of materials and approaches to examine the development of the modern European city in the contemporary world. It uses cultural sources such as film, photography, literature and music to see how the experience of the modern European city has been represented from the nineteenth century to the present day. The course also uses the history of the modern European city to explore historical issues such as the experience of war, poverty and wealth, social reform, and the growth of cosmopolitanism and multiracialism. It explores the material space of urban development by looking at architecture, urban planning and housing. The course reflects upon current social and political issues in the modern European city, such as gentrification, popular protest and globalization. Though the course will discuss the culture and history of European cities, it focuses upon the examples of Paris and London from the mid nineteenth century to the present day. The course will explore the human experience of modern European cities, including discussions of race, gender, sexuality and class in the modern city, the physical shape of cities, and the cultural representation of city life. Particular topics covered include popular culture from caf\u00e9 life to dancehalls; the photography of twentieth-century Paris; cosmopolitanism and the modern city; class conflicts in the city; the city on screen; fashion and postwar Paris and London; and radical movements in the city. Sources include novels such as Ther\u00e8se Raquin by Emile Zola and Absolute Beginners by Colin MacInnes, the photography of Robert Frank and Roger Mayne and documents on the London Blitz. The emphasis in this course is developing skills such as analytical thinking, reading and writing. Note: History majors and minors cannot take this course to satisfy the six credits required at the 1000-level in History for major or minor.",

It examines the historical underpinnings of Japan as we see it today-economy, society, culture, politics, its successes and failures. In a mere 150 years, Japan transformed itself from a feudal, decentralized regime into a highly centralized, internationally respected capitalist government and economy. We evaluate that history as reflected in society, the economy, cultural, politics, and international relations. Course credit exclusion: AP/HIST 3760 6.00.",

It pays attention to several phenomena that were instrumental in shaping the 1960s: the cultural revolution, the Hippies, University protest, the feminist movement, the protest movements in Europe and in the United States and their impact on Canada, the transformation of the political culture, the development of the Welfare State, and the rise of the independence movement in Quebec.

First, it aims at fostering those language skills which students using English as a second language need to succeed academically in the multicultural, English-medium context at York. The course accomplishes this goal primarily through content, rather than explicit language exercises, as is appropriate to learners at the university level. Second, the course aims to promote students' awareness of various aspects of Canadian society through the discussion and analysis of a range of texts exploring themes such as language and communication, culture and identity, and Canada's diverse communities. Note: This course comprises the English as a second language requirement for incoming English as a second language students. Course credit exclusions: AP/ESL 1450 6.00.",

Children's cultures are explored outside the parameters of adulthood, as a distinctive phase during which children are bearers and creators of an intricate social system that negotiates and influences their relationships with the world around them. This course explores how children perceive their own culture and how issues such as race, class, culture, gender, sexuality and ethnicity affect children in a globalized world. Rather than studying the unified concept of \"childhood\" this course embodies the idea that children in globalized communities create and foster their own distinct culture/s. Throughout the course students in the class are challenged to expand their ideas and preconceived notions of childhood and critically examine how culture, society and/or community contribute to our understanding of childhood through specific and focused contexts. Course credit exclusions: None. Note: Priority will be given to Children's Studies and Humanities majors and minors.",

To what extent should the owner of these rights be entitled to interfere with normal commercial practices in a modern global economy? The remedies available directly influence the value of the intellectual property right. Courts have granted intellectual property rights holders broad search and seizure powers and restraining rights through Anton Piller Orders and John Doe Injunctions. This course ex-amines the full extent of the remedies available to intellectual property holders, including injunctions, damages, accounting of profits, punitive damages, and delivery up, and how these remedies can be enforced internationally, particularly with respect to 'piracy' and 'grey marketing'.",

        "Description": "This course deals with the notion of risk and the ways to manage it, by exploring the general framework of risk management for businesses, individuals and societies, and by focusing on the role of insurance as a risk transfer mechanism. More specifically, the course categorizes and studies those risks that are associated with financial markets (liquidity risk, pricing risk, credit risk, among other financial risks) as well as those risks that arise from operations of an enterprise, regulations, digital transformation, the impacts of the environment or a catastrophe (among other non-financial risks). Also, the course examines in detail the various aspects of the insurance mechanism as a route to manage some of the aforementioned risks. The course combines classical lectures with biweekly presentations by visiting risk professionals, thus immersing the students into theory and practice of modern risk management.

Why are they being created? Who buys them and how do they fit into a pre-existing investment portfolio? How should they be priced/valued? What are their regulatory and tax implications? Can they be synthesized using existing securities? How profitable are they for the issuer/underwriter? Prerequisite: SB/MFIN 5400 3.00.",

Students are assumed to have taken an introductory course in derivatives. The objective of this course is to develop modelling skills needed to value the full range of derivative securities: from exchange-traded options to over-the-counter products including exotic options, embedded options and credit derivatives. The fundamental theory is the Equivalent Martingale Pricing Principle or the Risk-neutral valuation by no-arbitrage. Analytical models and various numerical methods will be discussed in detail. It is assumed that students are familiar with the Black-Scholes and binomial pricing models. Prerequisite: SB/FINE 6800 3.00",

        "Description": "In this course students work in large groups to realize substantial creative projects. Students work together as a creative team by taking on roles where they focus on specific aspects of the project. The creative team structure is modeled on teams used in large-scale project development such as those used in contemporary art practice, and interactive experience development that rely on collaboration and interdisciplinary research. The projects will vary from year to year, but will be significant works that are clearly defined by the instructor. The course instructor will prepare descriptions of the projects at the beginning of the course. The details of the projects will be developed as part of the class activities. The culmination of this course will be a final presentation, which will be open to the public. In addition to group assignments, students are evaluated based on their individual contribution, teamwork, and presentations. Prerequisites: third year standing and FA/VISA 2999 3.00. Not open to non-majors",

        "Description": "This experiential education course reflects the work term component of the Technology Internship Program (TIP). Qualified Honours students gain relevant work experience as an integrated complement to their academic studies, reflected in the requirements of a learning agreement and work term report. Students are required to register in this course for each four month work term, with the maximum number of work term courses being four ( i.e. 16 months). Students in this course receive assistance from the Career Centre prior to and during their internship, and are also assigned a Faculty Supervisor/Committee. Prerequisites: Enrolment is by permission only. Criteria for permission include: (1) that students have successfully completed at least nine PHYS credits at the 3000-level or higher, and have a GPA of at least 5.00 in SC/PHYS courses overall; (2) that students are enrolled full-time in the Honours program prior to beginning their internship and have attended the mandatory preparatory sessions as outlined by the Career Centre; (3) that students have not been absent for more than two consecutive years as a full-time student from their Honours degree studies; (4) that upon enrolling in this course students have a minimum of nine credits remaining towards their Honours degree and need to return as a full-time student for at least one academic term to complete their degree after completion of their final work term. Registration in SC/PHYS 3900 0.00 provides a record on the transcript for each work term.",

        "Description": "In this fully online course we will examine the cultural impact of sex and drugs in live performance historically and in the present. The terms sex, drugs, and theatre will be intricately deconstructed to show the multiple points of connection between live theatre and sex, sexuality, and gender, and the way these sometimes intersect with natural and/or induced states of ecstasy and inebriation. We will work with traditional play texts, experimental performance practices, popular performance forms, and activist performance interventions to understand the ways that desire, addiction, and the will to achieve transcendence permeate theatrical practice. Open to non-majors.",

This course explores how children perceive their own culture and how issues such as race, class, culture, gender, sexuality and ethnicity affect children in a globalized world. Rather than studying the unified concept of \"childhood\" this course embodies the idea that children in globalized communities create and foster their own distinct culture/s. Throughout the course students in the class are challenged to expand their ideas and preconceived notions of childhood and critically examine how culture, society and/or community contribute to our understanding of childhood through specific and focused contexts.

First, it aims at fostering those language skills which students using English as a second language need to succeed academically in the multicultural, English-medium context at York. The course accomplishes this goal primarily through content, rather than explicit language exercises, as is appropriate to learners at the university level. Second, the course aims to promote students' awareness of various aspects of Canadian society through the discussion and analysis of a range of texts exploring themes such as language and communication, culture and identity, and Canada's diverse communities. Note: This course comprises the English as a second language requirement for incoming English as a second language students. Course credit exclusions: AP/ESL 1450 6.00.",

The relentless emergence of Innovative technologies affects every area of legal theory and practice today. This course examines those challenges to the rule of law by novel technologies in media and news gathering, the internet of things, robotics, infrastructure, and other inventions that dramatically alter our social, commercial, political, and personal networks. We review the basic tenets of criminal law and study the idiosyncrasies of digital tools that increase our exposure to data manipulation. We consider the internet as a tool, target, and template of crime and incorporate a Canada-US-EU-Asia comparative study of the role of law to protect privacy, security, free speech, and reputation. We also briefly debate concepts of practice: court procedure, admissible evidence, burdens of proof, rights of the accused and victim (or the parties in civil litigation), and how resolution is theorized and constructed. The course includes a primer in researching and writing a paper at the graduate level. The course meets LSO continuing education requirements and will appeal to those interested in privacy and security law, criminal law, biotechnology law, law and society, law and technology studies, law and policy making, and related disciplines.",
